üîç Data Analysis with SQL Server
________________________________________

I worked on the transaction data to uncover key insights like:

‚Ä¢	Breaking down sales by product categories and understanding their share of total sales

‚Ä¢	Finding the best days and times for sales performance

‚Ä¢	Tracking monthly sales and revenue trends

‚Ä¢	Comparing how sales perform on weekdays versus weekends

‚Ä¢	Evaluating daily sales against overall averages



Here‚Äôs how I approached the analysis:
________________________________________

‚Ä¢	Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries with multiple CTEs and subqueries

‚Ä¢	Using window functions like AVG(), LAG(), and SUM() OVER() to spot trends and revenue growth

‚Ä¢	Adjusting column data types to improve data accuracy and structure

‚Ä¢	Cleaning the data and ensuring its quality

‚Ä¢	Applying time intelligence analysis, like month-over-month revenue growth broken down by store location, product type, and category

‚Ä¢	Segmenting sales by hour to pinpoint peak sales times


üìä Interactive Dashboard Design in Power BI
________________________________________

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that clearly presents the results and supports better decision-making, including:

‚Ä¢	Tracking total sales and month-over-month revenue growth, with detailed views by store location, product type, and category

‚Ä¢	Automatically highlighting the best sales day and hour based on the month selected

‚Ä¢	Using customized tooltips to highlight key performance indicators and make the data easier to understand
